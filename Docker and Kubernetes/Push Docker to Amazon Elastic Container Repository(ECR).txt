Here One Registery contains one image and its different verisons it can store upto 1000 versions in a single repo


This is private registery

First thing we need is AWS Cli installed in our laptop to run aws commands

To puch and image to the ECR repo first step is always docker login



Now build the image

Image Naming in docker regisitries

-> registryDomain/imageName:tag

then tag the imagae with aws repo name first 
ex- 

-> docker tag my-app:latest  5685.dkr.ecr.eu-cnetral-1.amazonaws.com/my-app:latest

	Now push the image with new name -

-> docker push 5685.dkr.ecr.eu-cnetral-1.amazonaws.com/my-app:latest


VOLUMES IN DOCKER

There is a concept of volumes in docker which is used to persist data of containers
normally if we stop a container all the data of container also gets removed with it

We attach volumes to our container to persist the data.

Now to maintain that data even after container is closed we use volumes in this 
the data gets stored in the directory/folder of host system.
