Docker volumes 
it has virtual file system so on restart each time containers start with new state and previous data get lost so that's why we need docker volume

On a host we have physical file system 
we plug the path of physical file system path to the containers


Folder in physical host file system in mounted into the virtual file system of Docker

when containers write data in its file system. it gets autimatically written in host system.
Data gets automatically replicated.

if i change something in host system it will also appear on containers as well.

So now when the container restarts it gets the data automatically from the host sytem file/folder because of volumes concept

There are 3 types of volumes :

HOST VOLUME
basically to create docker volumes is using

docker run command
 
ex - 

docker run -v /home/mount/data:/var/lib/mysql/data (reference of host directory : container directory)

This type of volume is called host volume
here we decide where to store data in host system

2 docker run -v /var/lib/mysql/data   (only giving reference of container directory)

now docker takes care of creating files on host system for volumes

It is called as Anonymous volumes

3 is improvement of ananymous 

docker run -v nameoffolderhostsyste:/var/lib/mysql/data

it is called as Named Volumes


*** Mostly we use named volumes


ex

version: ""
services:
	mongodb:
		image: mongo
		ports:
		   - "27017:27017"
		volumes:
			- db-data:/var/lib/mysql/data
			- created-volume-name:container-virtual-directory
			- mongo-data:/data/db         // example of using volume which is created below




volumes:              # Creating volume to store container data in local host directory
  mongo-data:         # We can create multiple volumes here just by passing list of volumes like below
    driver: local   
  reactive-app-data:
    driver: local    


Path of docker volumes in local host system

is C:\ProgramData\docker\volumes
